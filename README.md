# Space Bounce

Welcome to the official repository of "Space Bounce," a captivating one-tap game that has seen a journey of growth and triumph. Originally published on the Google Play Store under the name "Star Bubble," this game represents not just a fun and engaging experience but also a testament to clean development with a focus on efficiency and ease of development.

## Game Overview

"Space Bounce" is a mellowed-down version of "Star Bubble," crafted carefully for a game jam organized by Simple Viral Games. This simple yet enthralling one-tap runner surpassed all expectations and clinched its spot in the competition.
